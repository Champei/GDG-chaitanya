# PS-1
# TASK-1
This project implements an end-to-end financial time series forecasting engine using Keras (TensorFlow) and LSTM neural networks, designed specifically to model uncertainty and volatility in market data rather than producing a single point estimate.

The system trains on historical stock data and produces:
- Historical trend visualization
- 7-day forward forecasts
- Shaded confidence intervals (quantile-based)
- Accuracy metrics (RMSE, MAE)

# TASK-2
This project implements a chat-bot using libraries from langchain like PyPDFLoader RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter,FAISS,HuggingFaceEmbeddings,ChatGroq,ConversationalRetrievalChain,ConversationBufferMemory,Tool, initialize_agent,ChatMessageHistory,MessagesPlaceholder . Often called as RAG(retrieval augmented generation)
